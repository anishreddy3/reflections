What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When we initialize a repository we get a .git folder which makes that folder a 
repository and it contains all the metadata for that respective git repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area clubs all files that are added to it to make them as a single commit
and it can be really helpful and is different from working directory and repository
where it is not possible in them.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

The staging area is a nice feature to make sure we make commits only for a logic change and acts 
as a nice intermediate between working directory and repository.
