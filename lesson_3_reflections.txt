When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to keep a remote repository when I want to contribute my work to others or get help
to complete a part of my project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I think it is much better to manually pull changes as needed as some changes might
not be really necessary to work at that moment.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks are used when we clone a branch on git hub servers whereas clone is used to clone repositories from
gitub to local systems or create another copy on the local system. Branches are used to label commits
and are used to create separate versions of the code for different purposes.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

It is benefecial to have a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally as we can
edit conflicting ideas from different people while merging and make it match our requirements.
