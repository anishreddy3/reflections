When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

I would want to keep a remote repository when I want to contribute my work to others or get help
to complete a part of my project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I think it is much better to manually pull changes as needed as some changes might
not be really necessary to work at that moment.
